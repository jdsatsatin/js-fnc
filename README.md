# js-fnc

> This repository is for practicing JavaScript functions and concepts.

## Overview

This project contains a collection of JavaScript functions, utilities, and code snippets. It is intended as a playground for learning, experimenting, and improving JavaScript skills.

## Structure

- **strings/**: String manipulation functions (e.g., split.js)
- More folders and files will be added as new topics are explored.

## Usage

Feel free to explore, modify, and add your own JavaScript functions. Each file is self-contained and demonstrates a specific concept or utility.

## How to Run Files

To execute a JavaScript file using Node.js:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the file:
   ```sh
   cd foldername
   ```
2. Run the file with Node.js:
   ```sh
   node filename.js
   ```

Replace `foldername` and `filename.js` with the actual folder and file names you want to run.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/js-fnc.git
   ```
2. Open the files in your favorite code editor (e.g., VS Code).
3. Run and test the functions using Node.js or in the browser console.
